##Development

Puppet Labs modules on the Puppet Forge are open projects, and community
contributions are essential for keeping them great. We canï¿½t access the
huge number of platforms and myriad of hardware, software, and deployment
configurations that Puppet is intended to serve.

We want to keep it as easy as possible to contribute changes so that our
modules work in your environment. There are a few guidelines that we need
contributors to follow so that we can have a chance of keeping on top of things.

You can read the complete module contribution guide [on the Puppet Labs wiki.](http://projects.puppetlabs.com/projects/module-site/wiki/Module_contributing)
